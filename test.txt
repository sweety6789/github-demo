I've recently become obsessed with the sheer amount of development activity happening on sites like GitHub.

As a first project on working with this data, I thought it would be fun to rank all the programming languages by counting how many people on GitHub use each language.

I'm using the GitHub Archive and GHTorrent projects as data sources for this analysis. The GitHub Archive provides a record of every public event on GitHub since early 2011. This includes an event every time someone has pushed new code, forked or starred a repository, or opened an issue on GitHub. Overall the GitHub Archive has more than 1.25 Billion events on more than 75 Million different repositories. GHTorrent goes even further and hits the GitHub API for each event - which lets me resolve the language for most repositories.
